# Shiny App Project

This repository contains a Shiny App built in R for interactive data visualization and analysis. The app allows users to explore data stored in the provided "data.xlsx" file through an intuitive web interface.

## Files

- `app.R`: This file contains the code for the Shiny App. It defines the user interface layout and functionality, as well as the server-side logic for data manipulation and visualization.
- `data.xlsx`: This Excel file contains the data used by the Shiny App for visualization and analysis. Ensure this file is placed in the appropriate directory for the app to access it correctly.
